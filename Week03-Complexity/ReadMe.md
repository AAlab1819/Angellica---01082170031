#492B-Vanya and Lanterns



In this problem there is a problem that is how to find the minimum light radius every number of lights must have a length of street lighting. To solve this problem, the solution here is to first calculate the distance from 0 to the first lantern, then the end to the last lantern, and open between the lanterns by sorting out the location of the lantern in a way that does not decrease. We then split the biggest gap with two to find the fingers, because it was between two lanterns. We found the biggest number among the three and printed it ...



Complexity:


Worst Case: O (cognitive)


Average Case: θ (nlogn)


Best Case: Ω (nlogn)


The complexity is O (cognitive) because it uses some kind of STL, which is not a problem that will enter here.

#148A-Insomnia Cure

Insomnia means the difficulty of falling asleep, and honestly I also sometimes experience insomnia. And in this matter we must calculate how many dragons are damaged from the princess's attack. This code is quite simple, because the first thing to do is to enter the princess's attack method k, l, m, n and the total dragon. Then, using the 'for' and 'if' functions, we can determine if there are damaged dragons or escape safely(%). In the function, will increase the number of damaged dragons. In the end, print the number of damaged dragons as output.


Complexity:


Worst Case: O(n)


Average Case: θ(n)


The complexity is O(n) because it normally gets to the for loop which goes from 1 to the number of dragons. 


Best Case: Ω(1)


It is possible if one of the four input is 1.

#469A-I Wanna Be The Guy


For this matter, we will guess if the players The Little Brothers, Little X and Little Y will be able to finish the game and become the man. The Little Brother can play any level in any order, but they must complete all levels to become men, or they will lose. The solution to this problem will begin by declaring an array of all levels with 1 and when Little X or LIttle Y can break the level to change it to 0. Finally, to loop once again to check if there are unsolved levels. If there is an unresolved output level "Oh, my keyboard!". On the other hand, if all levels are solved the output "I am the person."


Complexity:


Worst Case: O (n)


Average Case: θ (n)


Best Case: Ω (n)


The complexity is O (n) because it will enter a loop for for input and when it checks for an unsolved level.
